PeerSupportApp,PeterHart23/PeerSupportApp,https://github.com/PeterHart23/PeerSupportApp,"This application was created as a way for CSU students to connect with each other while monitoring their personal mental health. The app has a search page to find other students and see what their major, academic level, and interests are. Once a fellow student has been found, they can be added as a friend and the chat functionality is unlocked between the two. Also, the main page contains an EMA (Ecological momentary assessment) which is basically a short survey that tracks how the student‚Äôs behaviors and school life is currently going. This app helps improve students‚Äô mental health by connecting students with common interests and providing a way for students to track their personal mental health."
