Global-Wheat-Detection-From-University-of-Saskatchewan,reddyprasade/Global-Wheat-Detection-From-University-of-Saskatchewan,https://github.com/reddyprasade/Global-Wheat-Detection-From-University-of-Saskatchewan,"Global WHEAT Dataset is the first large-scale dataset for wheat head detection from field optical images. It included a very large range of cultivars from differents continents. Wheat is a staple crop grown all over the world and consequently interest in wheat phenotyping spans the globe. Therefore, it is important that models developed for wheat phenotyping, such as wheat head detection networks, generalize between different growing environments around the world."
